# Domain-Adaptation

Unsupervised domain adaptation involves training a model on a source domain and deploying it on a target domain with different data distributions. However, existing methods often struggle with accurately predicting new classes in the target domain that are absent in the labeled source domain, leading to misclassification and reduced performance. In this project, we propose a modification to address this limitation by introducing an ”unknown” class during prediction and incorporating clusters within it. By explicitly labeling new instances as ”unknown,” we prevent misclassification as existing classes and improve the model’s adaptability. Additionally, clustering techniques within the unknown class capture similarities among new classes, enabling nuanced representation and better analysis of unknown samples. Through experiments, we demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in enhancing the adaptability and performance of unsupervised domain adaptation tasks, offering a robust framework for domain adaptation using
backpropagation.
